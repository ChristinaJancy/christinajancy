### Hi there, I'm Christina! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 25 year old Danish/Faroese multimedia designer, living in Denmark. 
I have experience in working professionally with design and development of web solutions, games (3D/VR), communication, digital video and UX. 
I love front-end coding, editing and in general just playing around with the different Adobe programs. 
In my spare time I enjoy photography, gaming and sometimes practising the piano.

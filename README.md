### Hi there, I'm Christina! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 24 year old half Danish/half Faroese student, living in Denmark. 
As a soon-to-be Multimedia Designer, I got experience in working professionally with design and development of web solutions, games (3D/VR), communication, digital video and UX. 
I love front-end coding, editing and in general just playing around with the different Adobe programs. 
In my spare time I also enjoy photography, gaming and sometimes practising the piano.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an intern at Tabtimize.com
